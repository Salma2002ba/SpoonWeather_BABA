#  Spoon Project

This project demonstrates how to use the **Spoon** library for code transformation, specifically focusing on transforming `if` conditions and converting `for` loops to `while` loops.

**Created by Salma BABA**  

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java** (JDK 11 or higher)
- **Maven** (for building and running the project)
- **Spoon** library (automatically included via Maven)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Salma2002ba/SpoonWeather_BABA.git
    cd SpoonWeather_BABA
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Navigate to the project root directory and install all dependencies using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean compile
    ```

3. **Run the Transformation**:
    - Execute the Spoon transformation to process the code in `WeatherAdvisor.java` and output the transformed version:
    ```bash
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.spoon.SpoonWeather"
    ```

    This will output something like:
    ```
    ========== SPOON TRANSFORMATION STARTED ==========
    ========== SPOON TRANSFORMATION COMPLETED ==========
    ```

4. **Run Tests**:
    - After performing the transformation, you can run the tests to compare the original and transformed versions. The tests will check if the behavior remains the same between both versions.
    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```

    **Expected Output**:
    ```
    Original Version Output:
    It's a cool day. Dress warmly.
    The sky is not clear. Keep an umbrella just in case.
    It's windy outside. Hold on to your hat!
    No rain today. You can leave your umbrella at home.

    Transformed Version Output:
    It's a cool day. Dress warmly.
    The sky is not clear. Keep an umbrella just in case.
    It's windy outside. Hold on to your hat!
    No rain today. You can leave your umbrella at home.

    Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
    ```

## How It Works

- **Transformation**:
    - The project uses Spoon to analyze and transform Java code. In particular, the transformation:
        - Inverts the condition in `if` statements and swaps their `then` and `else` blocks.
        - Converts `for` loops into `while` loops.

- **Test**:
    - The test compares the original `WeatherAdvisor.java` with the transformed version to ensure that the output remains consistent between the two versions.

## Troubleshooting

- **SLF4J Warning**: You may encounter a warning related to SLF4J:
    ```
    SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
    ```
    This is a known issue with the SLF4J logger, which doesn't impact the functionality of the Spoon transformations.



## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code, including:
    - `main/java/com/example/spoon/SpoonWeather.java`: Contains the logic for performing the transformations.
    - `test/java/com/example/spoon/WeatherAdvisor.java`: The original code to be transformed.
    - `test/java/com/example/spoon/WeatherAdvisorTest.java`: Tests comparing the original and transformed code.
  
- `target/`: Contains the compiled files and the generated transformed files.

- `spooned/`: Contains the transformed code after Spoon processes it.
